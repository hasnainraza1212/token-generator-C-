Introduction

The program consists of functions for identifying different types of tokens in a C++-style input string. These tokens include delimiters, operators, keywords, integers, real numbers, and valid identifiers.

Functions

isDelimiter: Checks if a character is a delimiter.
isOperator: Checks if a character is an operator.
isValidIdentifier: Checks if a string is a valid identifier.
isKeyword: Checks if a string is a keyword.
isInteger: Checks if a string is an integer.
isRealNumber: Checks if a string is a real number.
extractSubstring: Extracts a substring from a given string.
parseInputString: Parses the input string and identifies tokens.
main: The main function reads an input string, calls the parsing function, and displays the identified tokens.
Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

Copy the provided code.
Paste it into a C++ compiler or an online C++ compiler such as OnlineGDB.
Compile and run the program.
Enter a C++-style input string when prompted.
How it Works

The program reads an input string using getline.
The parseInputString function iterates through the characters of the input string, identifying and printing tokens such as operators, keywords, integers, real numbers, and valid identifiers.
The program demonstrates basic token recognition and is intended for educational purposes.
